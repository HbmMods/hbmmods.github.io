		<h2>The Tale of Two Lenses</h2>
		It's october of 2023. Having enough disposable income, I finally fulfilled a long dream of mine, buying a telescope. Figuring out what type of telescope I should buy didn't take very long, as this <a href="https://xkcd.com/1791/">xkcd comic</a> already managed to convince me with one single panel. A reflector telescope it shall be, since it doesn't suffer from chromatic aberration. Chromatic aberration. Huh.
		<h2>Shut the fuck up</h2>
		It's spring 2024. For a while now, once or twice a week, I spend my evening at my friend's place where we watch movies and have a smoke in his basement.
