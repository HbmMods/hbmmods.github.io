		<h2>How 2 Preview</h2>
        
		New preview: this is the last for now, next version will be the ugn update proper<br>
        A couple of things are still nto done though. Armor balance is shakey and i think fau armor has no stats at all, legendaries don't have recipes yet and aaren't hidden from creative, the purple legendary rounds don't have effects yet and the weapon sounds aren't final either.<br>
        Some b-sides don't exsit yet, but those are copy-paste anyway so let's not worry about that<br>
        Full release next week, so find as many bugs as you can.
