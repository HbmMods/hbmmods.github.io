	The World's Worst Devlogâ„¢ by Bob.<br>
	95% chance I will neglect this blog by the end of the month.<br>
	Made with love, entry-level knowledge of HTML and no responsive design whatsoever.<br>
	Rough layout shamelessly stolen from the Factorio Blog because I can't design anything unless it is a cube.<br>
	Entire frontpage is done in a single HTML file because GH pages doesn't support PHP, stock HTML is too fucking stupid to have a HTML composing feature (and yet somehow they have embeds and iframes which are the same thing plus extra crap you can't get rid of) and SHTML doesn't seem to work either. Web development is the fucking worst. The W3C should stop sniffing glue.<br>

			2024-07-04 <hr>
			Bedrock ores are kinda dumb if you think about it - too many types, too much maximum yield,
			nether ores being horrendous, too little processing variety...what do?
