The World's Worst Devlogâ„¢ by Bob.<br>
95% chance I will neglect this blog by the end of the month.<br>
Made with love, entry-level knowledge of HTML and no responsive design whatsoever.<br>
Rough layout shamelessly stolen from the Factorio Blog because I can't design anything unless it is a cube.<br>
